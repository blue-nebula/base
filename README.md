# Blue Nebula

**Blue Nebula** is a fork of [Red Eclipse 1](https://redeclipse.net). While the *Red Eclipse* team have moved their game on to another engine for their latest release, 2.0, this also meant a total conversion of the gameplay, in our opinion sacrificing some of the best aspects.

Therefore, a group of eager community members have started to fork off *Red Eclipse* from the last 1.x series release, setting up the necessary infrastructure to (re-)establish a community around *Red Eclipse* 1.5+.

We thank the *Red Eclipse* developers for providing us with one of the (if not the best) free software shooter, providing us with so many hours of fun. We build upon their great work and continue to support and maintain it.


## Download the game

The game has not officially been release yet. However, there are **beta-grade builds** available on our [release page](https://github.com/blue-nebula/release/releases/tag/continuous).

- For Linux, we recommend using our [AppImages](http://appimage.org/).
- For Windows, we consider creating an installer later on. For now, you can download a `.zip` archive containing both the game and the data.
- For macOS, we provide a binary archive, too. Please note that currently those have not been tested yet. Feedback welcome!

The builds are, as of yet, **fully compatible with Red Eclipse 1.5.8 to 1.6.0**.


## Get in touch

This project is still very young. We provide an official chatroom on the [Libera.Chat IRC network](https://libera.chat/). Our channel is [`#blue-nebula`](ircs://irc.libera.chat/blue-nebula).
Please do not hesitate to get in touch with us!


## Current state of Blue Nebula

We already provide our own [master server](https://github.com/TheAssassin/python-masterserver) (which also re-hosts the entries on the Red Eclipse master server) to which many more Blue Nebula servers are connected than to the Red Eclipse one. Check out our online server browser, [Blueflare](https://blueflare.assassinate-you.net).

Right now we are working on creating downloadable binaries, installers etc., as a first step in our journey to a standalone **Blue Nebula** game.

## About

Red Eclipse is a fun-filled new take on the first-person arena shooter, built as a total conversion of Cube Engine 2, which lends itself towards a balanced gameplay, with a general theme of agility in a variety of environments. For more information, visit our [Wiki](http://redeclipse.net/wiki) or [Forums](http://redeclipse.net/forum).

The project is a free and open source game built on the Cube Engine 2 using SDL and OpenGL which allows it to be ported to many platforms; you can [download a package](http://redeclipse.net/download) for Windows, GNU/Linux, BSD, and macOS; or grab a development copy from our [Git repository](http://redeclipse.net/devel) and live on the bleeding edge.


In a true open source by the people for the people nature, we try to work closely with the gaming and open source communities to provide a better overall experience, aiming to create a game environment that is fun and easy to play, while still having elements to master.

If you think you might have something to contribute to the game or community, please feel free to drop by our [IRC chatroom](http://redeclipse.net/chat) or [forums](http://redeclipse.net/forums) and talk to us directly. We try to maintain a standard of friendly behaviour in our community, so don't be afraid to speak up and have your say in building this game for us all! :)
